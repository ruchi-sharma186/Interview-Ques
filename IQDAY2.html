  New semantic tags like article, section, nav, and header are introduced for better structure.
  audio, video, and canvas are added for multimedia support.</p>
<h3>Ques50.If I do not put !DOCTYPE html will HTML 5 work?</h3>
<p>No, HTML5 may not work properly without !DOCTYPE html.

<p>No, html is notbis case-sensitive.</p>  
<h3>Ques54.When are comments used in HTML?</h3>
<p>Comments in HTML are used to add notes or explanations within the code. They are ignored by the browser and do not affect the page's display. 
  They are helpful for documenting the code or temporarily disabling sections of code during development.
 Example:
  <!-- This is a comment --></p>
<h3>Ques55.What are Attributes and how do you use them?</h3> 
<p>Attributes in HTML provide additional information about an element. They are placed inside the opening tag and consist of a name-value pair.
   Attributes modify the behavior or appearance of an element.  </p>  
  Example:
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description" width="500"><br>
  In this example:--
   src, alt, and width are attributes of the <img> element.

<h3>Ques56.What do you mean by for attributes in label tag.</h3> 
<p>The for attribute in the <label> tag is used to associate the label with a specific form element. 
  It links the label to an input field by matching the for value with the input element's id.
   This improves accessibility and allows the user to click the label to focus on the associated input.</p>
Example:
<label for="username">Username:</label>
<input type="text" id="username">
<h3>Ques57.How to create a Hyperlink in HTML?</h3>

  Unordered List (ul):
  <ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
  </ul>
  Ordered List (ol):
  <ol>
    <li>First</li>
    <li>Second</li>
    <li>Third</li>
  </ol>
  Definition List (dl):
  <dl>
    <dt>Term 1</dt>
    <dd>Definition 1</dd>
    <dt>Term 2</dt>
    <dd>Definition 2</dd>
  </dl>
<h3>Ques59.Which attributes is required in input tag.</h3>  
<p>The only required attribute in the input tag is type, which specifies the kind of input (e.g., text, password, number).</p>
  <input type="text">
  Other attributes like name, value, and placeholder are optional depending on the context.

<h3>Ques60.What do you mean by MARKUP language and hypertext in HTML?</h3>
<p>A **markup language** (like HTML) is used to structure and format content, while **hypertext** refers to text that 
  contains links to other texts or resources, enabling navigation.</p>  
  Markup Language (HTML):
  <p>This is a <strong>paragraph</strong> with <em>formatted</em> text.</p>
  Hypertext (HTML with links):
  <a href="https://www.example.com">Click here to visit Example</a>


<h3>Ques61.How are active links different from normal links?</h3>
<p>Active links are links that are being clicked or are in the process of being visited, 
  while normal links are just regular links that haven't been interacted with yet.</p>

  Example:-
Normal Link:
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>

<h3>Ques62.What happens if there is no text between the tags? Does this affect the display of the HTML file?</h3>
<p>If there is no text between the tags, the HTML file will still render normally, but nothing will be displayed for that specific element.
   Empty tags like `<p></p>` or `<div></div>` don't affect the layout, but they also won't show any content.</p>

<h3>Ques63.What are the limits of the text field size?</h3>
<p>The limits of a text field's size are determined by the size attribute (for visible width) and the maxlength attribute
   (for the maximum number of characters allowed).</p> 
Example:-  <input type="text" size="20" maxlength="50">
In this example:--
The text field will display 20 characters wide.
The user can type up to 50 characters.  

<h3>Ques64.What is the relationship between the border and rule attributes?</h3>
The border and rule attributes both control the appearance of table borders, but they are used differently:

border: Specifies the width of the border around a table or its cells (e.g., border="1").
rule: Controls which borders are drawn inside a table (e.g., rules="all" to display borders between all cells).
Example:
<table border="1" rules="all">
  <tr><td>Cell 1</td><td>Cell 2</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Ques65.What is Cell Spacing and Cell Padding?</h3>
<p>Cell Spacing: The space between the borders of adjacent cells in a table (set using the cellspacing attribute).
  Cell Padding: The space between the content of a cell and its border (set using the cellpadding attribute).</p>
  Example:--
  <table cellspacing="10" cellpadding="5">
    <tr><td>Cell 1</td><td>Cell 2</td></tr>
  </table>
 <p> Here, cellspacing adds space between cells, and cellpadding adds space inside each cell.</p>

<h3>Ques66.What is difference between HTML and XHTML?</h3> 
<pre>The main differences between HTML and XHTML are:

  HTML is more lenient with syntax (e.g., optional closing tags, case-insensitive).
  XHTML is stricter, requiring all tags to be properly closed, case-sensitive, and well-formed.
  In short, XHTML is a stricter, XML-based version of HTML.</pre>
  HTML:


<p>This is a paragraph
<a href="https://www.example.com">Link</a></p><br>
XHTML:
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
<a href="https://www.example.com">Link</a>

<h3>Ques67.How many types of CSS can be included in HTML?</h3>
<pre>There are three types of CSS that can be included in HTML:

  Inline CSS: Directly within an HTML element using the style attribute.
  <p style="color: blue;">This is blue text.</p>
  Internal CSS: Inside the <style> tag in the <head> section of the HTML document.
  
  <style>
    p { color: red; }
  </style>

  External CSS: Linked to the HTML file through a separate .css file using the <link> tag.
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  </pre>

<h3>Ques68.What are logical and physical tags in HTML?</h3>  
<pre>Logical Tags: Define the meaning or role of content, independent of how it’s displayed. 
  They focus on the content's structure. Examples include:-

  <em> (emphasis)</em>
  <strong> (strong importance)</strong>
  <code> (code snippet),</code>

  Physical Tags: Define how content should be displayed or styled, affecting the appearance. 
  They are more about formatting. Examples include:-
  <b> (bold)</b>
  <i> (italic)</i>
  <u> (underline)</u>
</pre>
<h3>Ques69.How can you apply JavaScript to a web page?</h3>
You can apply JavaScript to a web page in three ways:

  Inline JavaScript: Directly within an HTML element using the onclick, onload, etc. attributes.
  <button onclick="alert('Hello!')">Click Me</button>

  Internal JavaScript: Inside a <script> tag in the <head> or <body> section.
  <script>

<h3>Ques70.How to make you radio button and check-box. and how to implement this??</h3>
To create a radio button and a checkbox in HTML, you use the input tag with the appropriate type attribute. Here's how to implement them:

Radio Button:
Radio buttons allow the user to select only one option from a set.
<form>
  <label><input type="radio" name="color" value="red"> Red</label>
  <label><input type="radio" name="color" value="green"> Green</label>
  <label><input type="radio" name="color" value="blue"> Blue</label>
</form>
The name attribute groups the radio buttons together, allowing only one to be selected at a time.
Checkbox:
Checkboxes allow users to select multiple options.
<form>
  <label><input type="checkbox" value="music"> Music</label>
  <label><input type="checkbox" value="movies"> Movies</label>
  <label><input type="checkbox" value="sports"> Sports</label>
</form>

<h3>Ques71.What is main reason or main advantage of label tag?</h3>
<p>The main advantage of the label tag is that it improves accessibility and usability by allowing users to click the label to focus on the associated form element.</p>
<label for="username">Username:</label>
<input type="text" id="username" name="username">

<h3>Ques72.How will you implement when you click on submit button your whole data comes in URL form?</h3>
<p>To implement submitting data via the URL (using the query string), you can use the GET method in a form. This method appends the form data to the URL when the form is submitted.</p>
Example:
<form action="/submit" method="GET">
  <label for="username">Username:</label>
  <input type="text" id="username" name="username" required>
  
  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>
  
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
</body>
</html>
